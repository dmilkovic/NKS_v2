# NKS_v2
The idea of this project was to test which way of interaction with a web browser in Virtual Reality would be easier and more immersive. Two interaction modes - controlling the input with his hands which are tracked using a body tracking sensor or with controllers which come with Virtual Reality headset were tested on 10 subjects. Tests show us that Time to accomplish tasks was significantly lower (p < 0.05) for interaction mode with using controllers. There was also significantly lower (p < 0.05) TER (total error rate) in interaction mode with controllers.
